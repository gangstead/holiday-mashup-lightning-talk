Presentation "How Nodeschool organizes with open source" for http://info.thoughtworks.com/dallas-meetup-mashup.html

# The Slides
### TL;DR [Slides here](https://gangstead.github.io/holiday-mashup-lightning-talk)

Since the default branch is gh-pages, go to http://gangstead.github.io/holiday-mashup-lightning-talk to view the slides.

To view the slides locally start a [static http server](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) from that directory.  My preferred way:

```
# one time, to install the dependency
> npm install -g http-server

# start the server in the base directory. -o flag opens browser
> http-server -o
```
